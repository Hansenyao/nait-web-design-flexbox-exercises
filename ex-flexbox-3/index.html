                    <h2>Box Layout Models</h2>
                    <p>CSS provides different layout models to control the positioning and flow of elements on a web page.</p>
                    <!-- This element is a description list: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dl -->
                    <dl>
                        <dt>Block Layout</dt>
                        <dd>This model treats each element as a block-level box that occupies the entire width of its parent container by default. Block-level elements stack vertically, one after another, and you can control their width, height, margins, and positioning.</dd>
                        <dt>Inline Layout</dt>
                        <dd>In this model, elements are treated as inline boxes that flow horizontally within the text content. Inline elements do not break onto new lines by default and are typically used for text or smaller elements like links and spans.</dd>

                    <h2>Flexbox Layout</h2>
                    <p>The flexbox layout model is designed for one-dimensional layouts, either horizontally or vertically. It allows you to create flexible and responsive layouts by distributing space and aligning elements within a container.</p>
                    <p>Key features of flexbox include the flex container (the parent element that holds flex items and controls their layout behavior), and flex items (the direct child elements within a flex container).</p>

                <section>
                    <h2>Grid Layout</h2>
                    <p>The CSS grid layout model enables you to create complex two-dimensional layouts with rows and columns. It provides precise control over element placement and sizing within a grid container.</p>
                    <p>Grid layout offers powerful capabilities for creating complex and responsive designs, allowing you to precisely position and align elements on a web page.</p>
